Authon:

How to Use:
======================
The program is designed to take a background Image first and then the hand gesture.

After running the code:

1. When Webcam LED is on, it will pause 2 seconds and take background image snapshot.

2. A further 2 second pause and then it will take the hand gesture image snapshot.


The background is subtracted from the gesture image and the rest of the processing continues. The identification process only works on a single blob.
